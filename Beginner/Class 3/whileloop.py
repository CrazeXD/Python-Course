#While Loops

#Whie loops Can Be Used to Perform an Operation Multiple Times

#A while loop keeps operating until the condition is no longer True
#For example:
a = 0
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a += 1
#To create an infinite loop, you can use the following loop

while True: #Note that if you replace True with False, the loop will not work
    #You can also use a variable with the value True and say while variable == True or just while variable:
    print('')
