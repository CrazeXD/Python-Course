#To get user input, we can use the input() function in a variable

variable = input("What is your favorite song?")

#The text in the input function is the text you want on the line of your input. 
#If you don't want any, you can leave it blank
#The default input will take a string as input
#To change that, you can add another function around it

numinput = int(input("How old are you?"))
print(numinput, 'years old')
#There are other types of number values than int, but those can be ignored
