#Welcome! In this class, I'm going to be testing you on some basic topics in Python so I can gauge how well you know Python.
#Based on this, the next classes will help you progress in Python.
#First, let's start with a basic challenge.
#Please print out a shape that looks like this:
'''
#
##
###
####
'''
#Do not use 4 print statements. Use a for loop.

#Next, ask the user for a list of names until they type "done".
#Then, add those names to a list, and print them out in reverse order. Make this in a function. Do not use the .reverse() function.
