#In this class we will be doing some challenge questions in python that will help you with both algorithms and python in general
#However, I just want to quickly teach you all a small concept.
#First, the exit() command. 
#To exit a python program, simply call exit() anywhere in your code.

#Now for some challenges!!!


#Challenge 1: Given a list of people, return a list of the lengths of their names
#Challenge 2: Using the OS module, walk through a big folder anywhere on your computer. If the file is a .txt(check with the .endswith() function), print the contents of that file.
#Note: You may put the python file in the folder that you are navigating.

#Challenge 3: Make a clock app using the time module and Tkinter.
#Challenge 4: Given 2 files, one of usernames, and one of passwords, ask a user to login. If their username matches their password, print that they have succesfully logged in.
#Otherwise, tell them that they have entered an incorrect login.
